1. When a user enters New Offset value (by entering ESC; to jump to new Offset) and presses ENTER (as canonical is set ON, user requires to enter ENTER to submit their New Offset value), the entered value and any subsequent text occured on terminal screen is cleared, and this also includes the ERROR MESSAGE generated when user enters invalid value. The decision to allow "clearing of error messages" is taken because the error generated is actually send to STDERR stream and user can isolate it from the terminal output.
2. The return value "-1" of every function defined by me is reserved for indicating any error occured in any of the standard library functions.
3. Right now, If this program is interuppted by any signal and pushed it to background processes, when it is brought back as forground process, the behaviour of program is undefined. Currently working on this problem.

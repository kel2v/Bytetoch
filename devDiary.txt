1. Now repeated arguments are detected, an error is shown, and program is terminated.
2. From now, Options (commandline flags) are not validated based on number of arguments passed.
3. Note: don't press arrow keys (and some other keys which generate ESC) for scrolling as pressing such keys generate 'ESC' as input and program starts expecting for "new offset value".
4. Now the string entered as "new offset value" (after pressing ESC) is not erased. At stdout, if the entered "new offset" is valid, the output begins after a 'single' line gap and if it invalid, then output begins after 'two' lines gap.
5. Now the new (and more meaningful) concept of "Buffer" will be replacing the old "buffer" (struct), in which MAX_BUFFERSIZE number of bytes is loaded to a unsigned char array and this is utilised for printing output till shortage occurs.
6. Now unprintable characters are represented by '.' (dot), instead of previously used ' ' (space).

# bin
A simple program which displays bytewise data of a binary file, where each Byte is represented as a Hexadecimal value and its respective ASCII character (if it's Printable, else represented by a whitespace)

Note: The project is in primitive stage, hence it's not garanteed that it will work properly in any given system.
